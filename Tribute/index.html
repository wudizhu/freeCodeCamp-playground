                        Following the river ness to the north, you will find arguably the most famous lake of the Scotland - loch ness. 
                        However after visiting it several times, I find it to be rather liveless and lack of characters. 
                        So we set out to find some new lakes which we can show our guests from aboard. 
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        Cairngorms national park resides just east of loch ness. Discovering a 
                        new lake in this large lake network should be fairly easy. When we were driving aimless on the road, 
                        We encountered a signboard with a strange name - loch an eilein.
                    </p>
                    <p>       
                        It was a small lake with an irregular shape. The lake bank was not disrupted by man-made construtions. The rough stones and soft ground made it quite challenging
                        and exicting to walk along.         

                    </p>
